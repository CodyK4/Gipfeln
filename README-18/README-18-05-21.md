# Gipfeln Website

Thank you for taking the time to look at my site, This is the first time I have used as many CSS features as I can to create a responsive, beautiful looking website with animations,
modals, etc.- I will be using JavaScript where it is needed, mainly for modal popups.


# UPDATE 18/05/2021
--Uploaded live folder from cklaxon.co.uk/Gipfeln

Today is the first day I have uploaded the project anywhere other than my website, It still has some way to go before being complete, however I am fairly happy with the general
look and feel of the website currently, however I will be working to incorperate more features soon.


More coming soon...
